"""Programmatic contrastive pairs with certain labels (PLAN.md step 2).

Each item is a policy plus a case described by a few sentences. Every sentence carries zero or more explicit facts;
the label is a pure function `evaluate(facts)` of the facts present, returning UNDETERMINED when a required fact is
missing. A pair is the same item with exactly one sentence changed so that the label flips.

Two code-level checks run on every pair before it is kept (no model anywhere):
  ablation   : removing any evidence sentence (one that carries a required fact) makes the label UNDETERMINED,
               so the answer provably lives in the state, not in the instruction, the options, or the policy alone;
  invariance : removing any filler sentence leaves the label unchanged.
Evidence status is derived from the evaluator, not declared. Both siblings share `pair_id`/`family_id`, and
splits are assigned by family so siblings never straddle a split.
